      <p class="w3-large">The experience of Sprint 2 was really terrific. Here, we had to study O*NET website and create a unified schema for the Skills Ontology. Website consisted of robust data of 38 files, for which we found the linkage and created a schema using Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy).  Initially, analysing the data in the website created a turmoil, later after a great endeavour we were able to connect the threads of the data. Finally, we obtained 45K skills(technical, non-technical) from the website.</p>

        <p class="w3-large">The reason for choosing BERT algorithm is that it was developed by Google and it is the most lucrative NLP model available for context matching. By applying BERT, Google is able to understand the relationship between words in a query and present the closest matching result to the searcher.

        <p class="w3-large">FuzzyWuzzy algorithm is mainly used for string matching and hence we used it for matching the job titles. It also has more powerful functions to help with matching strings in more complex situations. The partial ratio() function allows us to perform 
            substring matching.

Several existing skill taxonomies (such as O*Net and ESCO) rely, at least in part, on expert consultation which means that updating the taxonomies can be a long and costly process. In contrast, a data-driven taxonomy like Nesta is easier to update.

        <p class="w3-large">Data regarding Job titles and skills mapping is secured and we couldn’t access it through the open API in EMSI website. But when we were inspecting the EMSI html page we found an API access token and we used that API access token and sent multiple API calls to the page and we were able to fetch the data in Job Title and skill mapped format but as we didn’t get the data legally, we are not use that data and also we are about to inform this data leakage issue to EMSI team.</p>

  <p class="w3-large">In sprint 6, we integrated NESTA in our unified schema and explored EMSI’s API and checked GitHub repositories to see if we could find any titles and skills mapping but we couldn’t retrieve any data. Later, we resorted to exploiting a data leak in EMSI's website through which we were able to retrieve job titles of a particular skill and  then we reverse mapped job titles to all the skills.</p>

    <p class="w3-large">NSDC was set up as part of a national skill development mission to fulfil the growing need in India for skilled manpower across sectors and narrow the existing gap between the demand and supply of skills. It aims to promote skill development by catalyzing creation of large, quality, for-profit vocational institutions. It consists of 24 Industry sectors and 36 sector councils.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">ESCO(European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations) works as a dictionary, describing, identifying and classifying professional occupations and skills relevant for the EU labour market and education and training. ESCO provides descriptions of 2942 occupations and 13,485 skills linked to these occupations, translated into 27 languages.</p>

  <h1 class="w3-center">Sprint 7</h1><br>
  <p class="w3-large">In this sprint, we were able to find an alternate solution to include EMSI skills in our taxonomy and for this we created a sample rule based algorithm and improved accuracy of BERT from 74% to 90%.To process the Job aggregation titles, we built a rule- based algorithm for the top five fortune companies individually. After processing the aggregation titles, we applied the Bert model on aggregation titles and EMSI titles and got the accuracy of 90% for 498 samples.</p>

    <h1 class="w3-center">Developed Rule based algorithm</h1><br>
    <p class="w3-large">To improve the efficiency of BERT NLP model, we had to improve the accuracy and this could be attained by cleaning and normalizing the Job Titles. We couldn't apply a specific cleaning format for 2,34,952 Job Titles as all of them were of different formats and we had to create rules company wise for 56 fortune companies and then clean them for achieving greater accuracy. Finally, we could improve the accuracy from 74% to around 91%.</p>

  <p class="w3-large">In this sprint, We have taken Job titles from 56 Job aggregators and normalized them,so that we can have a better version of the taxonomy. After normalizing, we tried to find similarities between these titles and EMSI titles using the BERT algorithm. Finally, we  analyzed the results with the previous sprint results and found an improvement of 16% in accuracy.</p>
